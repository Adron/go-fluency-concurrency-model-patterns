# Event Loop Pattern

## Overview

The Event Loop pattern processes events from multiple sources in a single thread using a central event loop. This pattern is essential for handling multiple event sources efficiently, managing I/O operations, building reactive systems, and coordinating multiple concurrent operations in a controlled manner.

## Implementation Details

### Structure

The event loop implementation in `examples/event_loop.go` consists of three main components:

1. **Event Loop** - Central coordinator that processes events from multiple channels
2. **Event Sources** - Multiple goroutines that generate events
3. **Event Processing** - Centralized event handling logic

### Code Analysis

```go
func RunEventLoop() {
    // Create event channels
    userEvents := make(chan string, 10)
    systemEvents := make(chan string, 10)
    timerEvents := make(chan string, 10)
    stop := make(chan struct{})

    // Start event sources
    go userEventSource(userEvents)
    go systemEventSource(systemEvents)
    go timerEventSource(timerEvents)

    // Start the event loop
    go eventLoop(userEvents, systemEvents, timerEvents, stop)

    // Let the event loop run for a while
    time.Sleep(5 * time.Second)
    close(stop)
    fmt.Println("Event loop stopped.")
}
```

### Event Loop Implementation

```go
func eventLoop(userEvents, systemEvents, timerEvents <-chan string, stop <-chan struct{}) {
    fmt.Println("Event loop started. Processing events...")
    
    for {
        select {
        case event := <-userEvents:
            fmt.Printf("Event Loop: Processing user event: %s\n", event)
            processUserEvent(event)
            
        case event := <-systemEvents:
            fmt.Printf("Event Loop: Processing system event: %s\n", event)
            processSystemEvent(event)
            
        case event := <-timerEvents:
            fmt.Printf("Event Loop: Processing timer event: %s\n", event)
            processTimerEvent(event)
            
        case <-stop:
            fmt.Println("Event Loop: Received stop signal, shutting down...")
            return
        }
    }
}
```

### Event Source Implementations

```go
func userEventSource(events chan<- string) {
    eventTypes := []string{"click", "keypress", "scroll", "hover", "submit"}
    for {
        event := eventTypes[rand.Intn(len(eventTypes))]
        events <- fmt.Sprintf("User %s", event)
        time.Sleep(time.Duration(rand.Intn(1000)+500) * time.Millisecond)
    }
}

func systemEventSource(events chan<- string) {
    eventTypes := []string{"file_change", "network_status", "memory_usage", "cpu_load", "disk_space"}
    for {
        event := eventTypes[rand.Intn(len(eventTypes))]
        events <- fmt.Sprintf("System %s", event)
        time.Sleep(time.Duration(rand.Intn(1500)+1000) * time.Millisecond)
    }
}

func timerEventSource(events chan<- string) {
    ticker := time.NewTicker(800 * time.Millisecond)
    defer ticker.Stop()
    
    for {
        select {
        case <-ticker.C:
            events <- fmt.Sprintf("Timer tick at %v", time.Now().Format("15:04:05.000"))
        }
    }
}
```

### Event Processing Functions

```go
func processUserEvent(event string) {
    // Simulate processing time
    time.Sleep(50 * time.Millisecond)
    fmt.Printf("  Processed user event: %s\n", event)
}

func processSystemEvent(event string) {
    // Simulate processing time
    time.Sleep(100 * time.Millisecond)
    fmt.Printf("  Processed system event: %s\n", event)
}

func processTimerEvent(event string) {
    // Simulate processing time
    time.Sleep(30 * time.Millisecond)
    fmt.Printf("  Processed timer event: %s\n", event)
}
```

## How It Works

1. **Event Sources**: Multiple goroutines generate events and send them to channels
2. **Event Loop**: A single goroutine runs the event loop, listening to all event channels
3. **Event Selection**: The `select` statement waits for events from any source
4. **Event Processing**: When an event arrives, it's processed by the appropriate handler
5. **Non-blocking**: The loop continues to process events from other sources while one is being processed
6. **Graceful Shutdown**: The loop stops when it receives a stop signal

The pattern ensures that all events are processed in a controlled, sequential manner while maintaining responsiveness to multiple event sources.

## Why This Implementation?

### Single-threaded Event Processing
- **Sequential Processing**: Events are processed one at a time, preventing race conditions
- **Predictable Behavior**: Event processing order is deterministic
- **Resource Efficiency**: No need for complex synchronization between event handlers
- **Debugging**: Easier to debug and reason about event processing

### Channel-based Event Sources
- **Asynchronous Generation**: Event sources can generate events independently
- **Non-blocking**: Event sources don't block when the event loop is busy
- **Buffering**: Buffered channels prevent event loss during processing delays
- **Scalability**: Easy to add or remove event sources

### Select Statement
- **Non-blocking Selection**: Waits for events from any source without blocking
- **Fair Selection**: All event sources have equal priority
- **Efficient Waiting**: Efficiently waits for multiple channels
- **Clean Code**: Provides clear, readable event handling logic

### Centralized Event Handling
- **Single Point of Control**: All events flow through one place
- **Consistent Processing**: All events are processed with the same logic
- **Easy Monitoring**: Easy to monitor and log all events
- **State Management**: Centralized state management for event processing

### Graceful Shutdown
- **Controlled Termination**: Event loop can be stopped gracefully
- **Resource Cleanup**: Proper cleanup of resources when stopping
- **Coordinated Shutdown**: All event sources can be coordinated during shutdown
- **No Data Loss**: Ensures no events are lost during shutdown

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Multiple Event Types**: Demonstrates handling different types of events
2. **Simulated Processing**: Random delays simulate real event processing time
3. **Buffered Channels**: Prevent blocking of event sources
4. **Structured Events**: Events have clear structure and meaning
5. **Proper Cleanup**: Graceful shutdown with proper resource cleanup

## Performance Characteristics

### Throughput
- **Sequential Processing**: Throughput limited by processing time of individual events
- **Event Queuing**: Events can queue in channels during processing delays
- **Fair Processing**: All event sources are processed fairly
- **Predictable Performance**: Performance is predictable and consistent

### Latency
- **Processing Time**: Latency depends on event processing time
- **Queue Time**: Events may wait in channels if event loop is busy
- **Fair Scheduling**: All event sources experience similar latency
- **Responsiveness**: System remains responsive to all event sources

### Memory Usage
- **Channel Buffering**: Memory usage depends on channel buffer sizes
- **Event Queuing**: Queued events consume memory
- **Efficient Storage**: Minimal overhead for event storage
- **Scalability**: Memory usage scales with number of event sources

### Monitoring and Observability

The event loop pattern is particularly effective when you have:
- **Multiple Event Sources**: Multiple sources generating events
- **Sequential Processing**: Need for sequential, controlled event processing
- **Resource Constraints**: Limited resources that need efficient management
- **Real-time Requirements**: Need for responsive event handling
- **State Management**: Complex state that needs centralized management

This pattern provides a robust foundation for building responsive, efficient systems that can handle multiple event sources while maintaining control and predictability.
