# Event Loop Pattern

## Overview

The Event Loop pattern processes events from multiple sources in a single thread using a central event loop. This pattern is essential for handling multiple event sources efficiently, managing I/O operations, building reactive systems, and coordinating multiple concurrent operations in a controlled manner.

## Implementation Details

### Structure

The event loop implementation in `examples/event_loop.go` consists of three main components:

1. **Event Loop** - Central coordinator that processes events from multiple channels
2. **Event Sources** - Multiple goroutines that generate events
3. **Event Processing** - Centralized event handling logic

### Code Analysis

Let's break down the main function and understand how each component works:

```go
func RunEventLoop() {
    // Create event channels
    userEvents := make(chan string, 10)
    systemEvents := make(chan string, 10)
    timerEvents := make(chan string, 10)
    stop := make(chan struct{})

    // Start event sources
    go userEventSource(userEvents)
    go systemEventSource(systemEvents)
    go timerEventSource(timerEvents)

    // Start the event loop
    go eventLoop(userEvents, systemEvents, timerEvents, stop)

    // Let the event loop run for a while
    time.Sleep(5 * time.Second)
    close(stop)
    fmt.Println("Event loop stopped.")
}
```

**Step-by-step breakdown:**

1. **Event Channel Creation**:
   - `userEvents := make(chan string, 10)` creates a buffered channel for user events
   - `systemEvents := make(chan string, 10)` creates a buffered channel for system events
   - `timerEvents := make(chan string, 10)` creates a buffered channel for timer events
   - `stop := make(chan struct{})` creates a signal channel for graceful shutdown
   - Buffer size of 10 prevents blocking when event sources generate events faster than processing

2. **Event Source Launch**:
   - `go userEventSource(userEvents)` launches the user event generator in background
   - `go systemEventSource(systemEvents)` launches the system event generator in background
   - `go timerEventSource(timerEvents)` launches the timer event generator in background
   - Each event source runs independently and continuously generates events

3. **Event Loop Launch**:
   - `go eventLoop(userEvents, systemEvents, timerEvents, stop)` starts the central event loop
   - The event loop runs in its own goroutine to process events from all sources
   - This is the core coordinator that handles all events sequentially

4. **Demonstration Period**:
   - `time.Sleep(5 * time.Second)` lets the event loop run for 5 seconds
   - This provides enough time to see the pattern in action
   - During this time, all event sources are generating events and the loop is processing them

5. **Graceful Shutdown**:
   - `close(stop)` signals the event loop to stop processing
   - The event loop will receive this signal and exit gracefully
   - `fmt.Println("Event loop stopped.")` confirms the shutdown

### Event Loop Implementation

```go
func eventLoop(userEvents, systemEvents, timerEvents <-chan string, stop <-chan struct{}) {
    fmt.Println("Event loop started. Processing events...")
    
    for {
        select {
        case event := <-userEvents:
            fmt.Printf("Event Loop: Processing user event: %s\n", event)
            processUserEvent(event)
            
        case event := <-systemEvents:
            fmt.Printf("Event Loop: Processing system event: %s\n", event)
            processSystemEvent(event)
            
        case event := <-timerEvents:
            fmt.Printf("Event Loop: Processing timer event: %s\n", event)
            processTimerEvent(event)
            
        case <-stop:
            fmt.Println("Event Loop: Received stop signal, shutting down...")
            return
        }
    }
}
```

**Event loop breakdown:**

1. **Function Signature**:
   - Takes read-only channels (`<-chan string`) for each event type
   - Takes a read-only stop channel (`<-chan struct{}`) for shutdown
   - Directional channels provide encapsulation and prevent accidental misuse

2. **Infinite Loop Structure**:
   - `for { ... }` creates an infinite loop that continuously processes events
   - The loop will run until explicitly stopped by the stop signal
   - This ensures the event loop is always ready to handle events

3. **Select Statement**:
   - `select` statement waits for events from any of the four channels
   - Non-blocking - if no events are available, it waits efficiently
   - Fair selection - all event sources have equal priority
   - Only one case executes at a time, ensuring sequential processing

4. **User Event Handling**:
   - `case event := <-userEvents:` handles user events (clicks, keypresses, etc.)
   - `fmt.Printf("Event Loop: Processing user event: %s\n", event)` logs the event
   - `processUserEvent(event)` calls the appropriate handler function
   - User events typically need quick response for good UX

5. **System Event Handling**:
   - `case event := <-systemEvents:` handles system events (file changes, network status, etc.)
   - `fmt.Printf("Event Loop: Processing system event: %s\n", event)` logs the event
   - `processSystemEvent(event)` calls the system event handler
   - System events may require more processing time

6. **Timer Event Handling**:
   - `case event := <-timerEvents:` handles timer events (periodic ticks)
   - `fmt.Printf("Event Loop: Processing timer event: %s\n", event)` logs the event
   - `processTimerEvent(event)` calls the timer event handler
   - Timer events are typically lightweight and frequent

7. **Stop Signal Handling**:
   - `case <-stop:` handles the shutdown signal
   - `fmt.Println("Event Loop: Received stop signal, shutting down...")` logs shutdown
   - `return` exits the event loop gracefully
   - This ensures clean termination without data loss

### Event Source Implementations

```go
func userEventSource(events chan<- string) {
    eventTypes := []string{"click", "keypress", "scroll", "hover", "submit"}
    for {
        event := eventTypes[rand.Intn(len(eventTypes))]
        events <- fmt.Sprintf("User %s", event)
        time.Sleep(time.Duration(rand.Intn(1000)+500) * time.Millisecond)
    }
}

func systemEventSource(events chan<- string) {
    eventTypes := []string{"file_change", "network_status", "memory_usage", "cpu_load", "disk_space"}
    for {
        event := eventTypes[rand.Intn(len(eventTypes))]
        events <- fmt.Sprintf("System %s", event)
        time.Sleep(time.Duration(rand.Intn(1500)+1000) * time.Millisecond)
    }
}

func timerEventSource(events chan<- string) {
    ticker := time.NewTicker(800 * time.Millisecond)
    defer ticker.Stop()
    
    for {
        select {
        case <-ticker.C:
            events <- fmt.Sprintf("Timer tick at %v", time.Now().Format("15:04:05.000"))
        }
    }
}
```

**Event source breakdown:**

1. **User Event Source**:
   - `eventTypes := []string{...}` defines realistic user interaction events
   - `for { ... }` creates an infinite loop for continuous event generation
   - `event := eventTypes[rand.Intn(len(eventTypes))]` randomly selects an event type
   - `events <- fmt.Sprintf("User %s", event)` sends the formatted event to the channel
   - `time.Sleep(time.Duration(rand.Intn(1000)+500) * time.Millisecond)` simulates variable user interaction timing (500-1500ms)

2. **System Event Source**:
   - `eventTypes := []string{...}` defines realistic system monitoring events
   - Similar structure to user events but with system-specific event types
   - `time.Sleep(time.Duration(rand.Intn(1500)+1000) * time.Millisecond)` simulates slower system event generation (1000-2500ms)
   - System events typically occur less frequently than user events

3. **Timer Event Source**:
   - `ticker := time.NewTicker(800 * time.Millisecond)` creates a ticker for regular events
   - `defer ticker.Stop()` ensures the ticker is cleaned up when the function exits
   - `for { select { case <-ticker.C: ... } }` waits for ticker events
   - `events <- fmt.Sprintf("Timer tick at %v", time.Now().Format("15:04:05.000"))` sends timestamped timer events
   - Timer events occur at regular 800ms intervals, providing predictable timing

### Event Processing Functions

```go
func processUserEvent(event string) {
    // Simulate processing time
    time.Sleep(50 * time.Millisecond)
    fmt.Printf("  Processed user event: %s\n", event)
}

func processSystemEvent(event string) {
    // Simulate processing time
    time.Sleep(100 * time.Millisecond)
    fmt.Printf("  Processed system event: %s\n", event)
}

func processTimerEvent(event string) {
    // Simulate processing time
    time.Sleep(30 * time.Millisecond)
    fmt.Printf("  Processed timer event: %s\n", event)
}
```

**Event processing breakdown:**

1. **User Event Processing**:
   - `time.Sleep(50 * time.Millisecond)` simulates quick user event processing
   - User events need fast response for good user experience
   - `fmt.Printf("  Processed user event: %s\n", event)` confirms processing completion

2. **System Event Processing**:
   - `time.Sleep(100 * time.Millisecond)` simulates longer system event processing
   - System events may require more complex processing (file I/O, network calls, etc.)
   - `fmt.Printf("  Processed system event: %s\n", event)` confirms processing completion

3. **Timer Event Processing**:
   - `time.Sleep(30 * time.Millisecond)` simulates lightweight timer event processing
   - Timer events are typically simple and fast to process
   - `fmt.Printf("  Processed timer event: %s\n", event)` confirms processing completion

**Key Design Patterns:**

1. **Single-threaded Event Processing**: The event loop processes events sequentially in a single goroutine, preventing race conditions.

2. **Channel-based Communication**: All event sources communicate with the event loop through channels, providing natural synchronization.

3. **Select Statement**: The `select` statement provides non-blocking, fair event selection from multiple sources.

4. **Buffered Channels**: Buffer size of 10 prevents event sources from blocking when the event loop is busy processing.

5. **Graceful Shutdown**: The stop channel provides clean shutdown without data loss or resource leaks.

6. **Structured Events**: Each event type has a clear structure and meaning, making the system easy to understand and extend.

7. **Simulated Processing**: Random delays simulate real-world processing times and make the pattern's behavior visible.

## How It Works

1. **Event Sources**: Multiple goroutines generate events and send them to channels
2. **Event Loop**: A single goroutine runs the event loop, listening to all event channels
3. **Event Selection**: The `select` statement waits for events from any source
4. **Event Processing**: When an event arrives, it's processed by the appropriate handler
5. **Non-blocking**: The loop continues to process events from other sources while one is being processed
6. **Graceful Shutdown**: The loop stops when it receives a stop signal

The pattern ensures that all events are processed in a controlled, sequential manner while maintaining responsiveness to multiple event sources.

## Why This Implementation?
